## 🚀 Features
* **Multi-Slot System:** Manage up to 4 independent message profiles (Tabs) at the same time. Each slot has its own text, interval timer, and targeted channels.
* **Dynamic Channel Detection:** The addon automatically detects which global channels you are currently connected to (Channels 1-6), alongside standard standard Say and Yell options.
* **Independent Controls & Master Switch:** Turn individual messages on or off instantly using their respective tickboxes. Control the entire broadcast engine with a single "Master Start/Stop" button.
* **Smart Item Linking:** Fully supports Shift-Clicking items, spells, and achievements directly into your custom message box.
* **Fail-Safe Configuration:** A dedicated "Save Text" button ensures your text, interval, and channel settings are only saved and applied to the engine when you are absolutely ready.
